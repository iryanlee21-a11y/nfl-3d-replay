# NFL 3D Replay Project 🏈

## 🎯 Goal
Recreate one NFL play in 3D and let users view it from player POVs (QB, RB, etc.) in Unity.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Detect & track players from video (Python/CV)
- Convert 2D pixel coordinates → 3D field coordinates
- Visualize motion in Unity and attach POV cameras
- Provide replay controls and switch player views

## ⚙️ Stack
Unity (URP), C#, Python, OpenCV, YOLO, DeepSORT, GitHub

## 📅 Plan (High-level)
- Weeks 1–4: Setup & data pipeline
- Weeks 5–12: Tracking & 3D mapping
- Weeks 13–24: Unity integration, POV, polish
